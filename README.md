# Catch Apple, not the Bomb

This is a simple 3D Unity program that allows the user to play a game by moving cursor left, right, top, and down to try to catch as many apples as possible within the limited time. Each apple caught gives user positive points and each bomb reduces the points. After time is up, this program calculates the number of points the user has gained this round and displays it on the screen as an end-game window.

This program is intended to run on the iOS platform by using Unity iOS builder setting along with Xcode program.
